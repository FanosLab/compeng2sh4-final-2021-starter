/*Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

for proper testing you need:
1) call the function by passing the input string
2) compare the output of the function with the golden output you expect from the function for the corresponding passed input
