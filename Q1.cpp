/*Adding Up Numbers
In this question we are interested in calculating 1+2+...+n, where
// Pre-condition: n is 1 or greater
// Post-condition: this functions returns the value of
// 1+2+3+...+n
// Examples: sum(1) is 1, sum(2) is 3, sum(3) is 6, ...


You are asked to complete the function signature as well as the function body for all the parts.
