/*Q3:
Write a program that reads in test scores and applies two different curves to them. 
The program should contain:
1) a base class ScoreBank with two private(or protected as needed) data members:  [refer to the ScoreBank.h and ScoreBank.cpp]
	-- an integer pointer for the scores and
    -- a float for the average. 
	The class should also contain the following methods:
	-- method EnterScores which:
    	** asks the user how many test scores are needed,
        ** allocates enough memory, and reads in the scores. 
    -- a method CalcAverage which:
        ** stores the average of the entered scores in the float data member. 
	-- a method printScores which:
        ** prints the list of test scores to the screen as well as the average. 
	-- Make sure to complete the given constructor and destructor. 
	    ** in the given constructor, you should free the memory alloacted in the class
		
2) Derive from ScoreBank a class Curve1 which contains:  [refer to the Curve1.h and Curve1.cpp]
    -- a method Curve which:
 	    ** sets the average score to 75. 
		** Find out how far away from 75 the actual average is and then
        ** add this value to each test score. 
	-- Overload the Output method to print: 
	    ** the original scores and
        ** the curved scores as well as
        ** the original and new average.

3) Derive from ScoreBank a class Curve2 which contains [refer to the Curve2.h and Curve2.cpp]
    -- a method Curve which:
        ** sets the high score to 100 and scales the rest of the scores accordingly.
		** the scale should be 100 divided by the highest score
        ** then multiply each score in the list with the scale.

    -- overload the Output function to print:
        ** the original scores,
        ** the new scores, and 
		** the averages for both sets.
		
Feel free to add any other methods or data members to the classes other than the ones Iâ€™ve mentioned if it will help you implement any of the required
features.


4) Write a main function driver for these classes that creates objects of type Curve1 and Curve2 and asks the user to input a list of test scores into each object and
then runs the Output functions from each object.
